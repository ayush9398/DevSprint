## Curriculum Vitae Rating Application
We consider the job requirement document and CV/Resume. After uploading both the documents, the user will receive a rating score of the uploaded CV/Resume against the corresponding job requirement which will be the measure of how likely is the Resume going to be shortlisted for the job requirement.
