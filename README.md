## Curriculum Vitae Rating Application
We consider the job requirement document and CV/Resume. After uploading both the documents, the user will receive a rating score of the uploaded CV/Resume against the corresponding job requirement which will be the measure of how likely is the Resume going to be shortlisted for the job requirement.

## Specification
Project is designed using simple Natural Language processing tools such as:  \
Text Classifier  \
POS Tagger  \
Text Summarizer  \
Text Keyword extraction and Text Matcher.  \
All these tools are used to designe a web-app for rating Resume and CVs.
